Dumie101 Fantasy League Project



Part 1: Free agents (Fast)

We need to draft the best free agents based off the point system. The highest value points are steals, blocks and 
field goals made. We need to search the free agents, and order based off steals, blocks and field goals made or we 
can measure points generated. For free agents we will remove players that are out or day-to-day as we are using free-agents 
to generate fast points and players who are out or playing day to day are risky. Since, we need to generate the maximum amount of points, 
we need players that play high amount of minutes. The max minutes per game (MPG) a player can have is 48 mins. We will look at players that have 
20+ mins and we will rank based on the amount of points generated, for 2020-2021, last 7 days, last 15 days, and last 30 days. We will also 
divided the average points generated with the average MPG therefore finding players that are the most efficient based on the amount of time they play. 
Since, they already get a decent amount of playing time already their minutes are likely to increase.
